## Title
Field-invariant quantitative magnetic-resonance signatures
## Abstract
A system that determines an invariant magnetic-resonance (MR) signature of a biological sample is disclosed. During operation, the system determines a magnetic-resonance (MR) model of voxels in a biological sample based on differences between MR signals associated with the voxels in multiple scans and simulated MR signals. The MR signals are measured or captured by an MR scanner in the system during multiple MR scans, and based on scanning instructions, and the simulated MR signals for the biological sample are generated using the MR model and the scanning instructions. Moreover, the system iteratively modifies the scanning instructions (including a magnetic-field strength and/or a pulse sequence) in the MR scans based on the differences until a convergence criterion is achieved. Then, the system stores, in memory, an identifier of the biological sample and a magnetic-field-strength-invariant MR signature of the biological sample that is associated with the MR model.

## Title
Fast scanning based on magnetic resonance history
## Abstract
During operation, a system iteratively captures MR signals of one or more types of nuclei in one or more portions of a biological lifeform based on scanning instructions that correspond to a dynamic scan plan. The MR signals in a given iteration may be associated with voxels having associated sizes at three-dimensional (3D) positions in at least a corresponding portion of the biological lifeform. If the system detects a potential anomaly when analyzing the MR signals from the given iteration, the system dynamically modifies the scan plan based on the detected potential anomaly, a medical history and/or an MR-scan history. Subsequent measurements of MR signals may be associated with the same or different: types of nuclei, portions of the biological lifeform, voxels sizes and/or 3D positions.

## Title
Systems and methods for hardware-based pooling
## Abstract
Described herein are systems and methods that utilize a novel hardware-based pooling architecture to process the output of a convolution engine representing an output channel of a convolution layer in a convolutional neural network (CNN). The pooling system converts the output into a set of arrays and aligns them according to a pooling operation to generate a pooling result. In certain embodiments, this is accomplished by using an aligner that aligns, e.g., over a number of arithmetic cycles, an array of data in the output into rows and shifts the rows relative to each other. A pooler applies a pooling operation to a combination of a subset of data from each row to generate the pooling result.
